* Uses mainly the openCV library, python3 and Google's MediaPipe library.
* This game can see your hand (using webcam) and detect the gesture, after which it will play with its randomly generated move.
* Real-time image classifier (SGD Classifier from sklearn) with 99.7% accuracy.
* Highly Interactive UI with features like scoreboard, multiple rounds and result declaration.
* To play this game, download the files from this repository to your computer > open terminal in the game folder > run the command "python3 main.py" (if you are being prompted to install some libraries to run the game, install those)
